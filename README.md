<div align="center">

This project was built as a template for a blog site.

<!-- <p align="center"><img src="images/wineocity.gif" alt="gif of wineocity site"></p> -->

It uses placeholder images from (https://www.pexels.com).

**Link to project:** (https://glistening-beignet-9b419e.netlify.app)

**How It's Made:**

Tech used: HTML, CSS, CSS Grid, Flexbox, placeholder images were used via VS Code extension from (https://pexels.com).

**Optimizations:**

I had difficulty getting the site responsive and kept refactoring the CSS code to have a simple layout and for the codebase to be easier to read and understand.

**Lessons Learned:**

Got this idea from the Udacity to build a blog site which I will continue to work on so that I can use it to write reviews on drinks.

**Thank You!**

Thank you for everyone who reviewed my code and helped me to become a better developer.
